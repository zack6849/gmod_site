                            We have our own youtube player setup on the server, it's neat to use, but to prevent
                            spamming of
                            it,

                            <b>Rules of the youtube player:</b>
                            If you want to request a song, then make sure your song isn't an offensive or overly vulgar
                            one.

                            To request a song, message a staff member, do not spam them, asking for the same song
                            repeatedly
                            will lead to you being ignored

                            Don't like the song currently playing? Mute it, whining about it is annoying.

                            As mentioned above, the youtube player is limited to staff only, however if you ask nicely,
                            a
                            staff
                            member may play your song for you.
